# FractalTracker
Real time fractal path analysis (RTFPA) for the Ubisense RTLS or log files.

# Reference
RTFPA works using a modification of the divider method proposed by Mandelbrot in his 1967 
paper "How Long is the Coast of Britain?". The modifications I've made are detailed in my
2011 article "Using fractal dimension to assess robot operator skill in a search task". If
you use, modify, derive from, or port to another language, the code in this project for 
academic purposes, please cite this article. Additionally, please include this request for 
citation in the derived work.
